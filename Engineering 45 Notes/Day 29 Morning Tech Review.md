# Day 29 - Morning Tech Review

# Tech Review

Agile : Embraces Change
Waterfall : Linear, Fixed Model : Good for Smaller, Repeatable projects eg in manufacturing, construction
V-Model : extension to Waterfall : Mission-critical where perhaps life is at stake so extra testing is vital : Heavy Industry, Military

Events
Delegates : Placeholder for a method
Delegate instance += Method
Event += Method
Declare event must use delegate type also event MyDelegate MyEvent
MyEvent += MyMethod;

TDD Test Driven Development - Tests first, code second
Red Green Refactor : Red (Tests fail) Green (tests pass) Refactor (faster)
BDD Behaviour Driven Development - Tests written in USER STORY FORMAT
User Story ... As a user ... when I log in ... I see the main menu screen
Gherkin/Cucumber
Selenium to test this sort of software (website)
Synchronous : Every line waits for line before (code appear to 'hang')
Async : Main thread which also has SUBTHREADS or TASKS which do BACKGROUND WORK and when they complete they trigger a CALLBACK METHOD WHICH THEN DOES SOMETHING USEFUL

CRUD
Event : EXTERNAL INTERACTION (EXTERNAL TO PROGRAM)
USER EVENTS EG Button Click/DoubleClick/MouseEnter/MouseLeave
DATA EVENTS EG Data onstart, oncontinue, onend..
% complete bar
http : // GET DATA
Request => client => server
Response server => client
fetch(url)
.then(callBackFunction) // named function
.then(function(){// use data}) // anonymous fn
.catch(error)
SQL
DISTINCT
AGGREGATE : MIN MAX AVG SUM COUNT
ROUND/FLOOR/CEIL
JOIN
UNIQUE - constraint on table column
JUNCTION TABLE
table1 table2 juction table mix of records from tables 1,2
LAMBDA s => s.ID=="22"
(s,t) => { return "hi"; }
REF use this to pass primitive type into a method and treat it like
a global variable
int x=10;
DoThis(ref int x){... alter x as a GLOBAL VARIABLE}
PRIMITIVE : in memory the data type is stored with data in single block
of memory
int, short, long float, double, bool, char, bit

    short 16bit
    	int  32bit
    	long 64bit
    
    	float 32
    	double 64
    	decimal  128

REFERENCE TYPE : bigger object eg array, collection (list),
string is array of char char[], class
VALUE TYPE : primitive (stored on STACK), struct (mini-class)

TUPLE (int x, string y) MyMethod(){ return (10,"hi"); }
(int , string )
