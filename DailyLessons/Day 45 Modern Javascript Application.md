# Day - 45 - Modern Javascript Application

# Installing A Modern Javascript Application

Building a modern front-end web application today is certainly non-trivial.

We don't in general just build HTML, CSS and Javascript and then host them on a website.

In general we use an underlying tool called NODEJS to build all websites

    NodeJS is JAVASCRIPT installed and running on your machine
    in the same way as we might install C#/Java/Python
    
    Basic Tools (command line)
    
    	node 		runs app
    
    	npm 		installs libraries
    
    							npm install <<library>> -g   (global)  --save (add to config
    											file for your project)
    
    	packages.json
    		list all libraries for project
    
    	yarn 		upgrade to npm  ((use this, better than npm))

React vs Angular vs Vue

    1. React ==> biggest, most widely-used library in world 
    
    		Facebook
    
    2. Angular ==> ??? don't use ??? 
    
    		Google 
    
    3. Vue ==> Best of Angular & React
    
    		==> START YOUR LEARNING WITH VUEJS
    
    		'Indie' project ie one man Evan Vue

Sample project with VUEJS

    Command line
    
    	npm install -g @vue/cli
    
    Add new project
    
    	vue create <<projectname>>
    	vue create vue-hello-world
    	cd vue-hello-world
    	npm start                               to run
    	npm run serve
    					(yarn serve)
    
    Deploy to GitHub
    
    Deploy to Netlify
    
    	Build command 		yarn run build
    	Publish directory   dist
    
    Folder structure
    
    	/src 				SOURCE CODE
    	/dist  				PUBLISH SITE FOR FINAL DEPLOYMENT (COMPACTED, FAST, RUNTIME
    								CODE)
