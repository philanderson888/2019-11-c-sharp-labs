# Day 6 - GitHub

# Familiar commands

    git pull
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push
    git init : initialise brand new repo
    .gitignore list of files/folders to be ignored when pushing to GitHub
    1) Config
    2) Private ((bad practice anyway : better to use ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES))
    3) build files have to be ignored because a) clog up your commits 
        b) rebuild every time you run your code anyway
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<<USER>>/<<REPO>>.git
    git status
    git log : identify all your COMMITS
    hash unique identifier which identifies a file eg a git commit
    git reset : GO BACK TO STATE OF A PREVIOUS COMMIT
    git reset
    --soft : GO BACK TO THE POINT IN TIME OF THAT COMMIT WITHOUT ERASING HISTORY (best)
    take this point and put it as the new HEAD
    --hard : GO BACK AND ALSO ERASE HISTORY TO THAT POINT
    HEAD : tip of your commits.
    git clean
    DANGER!!! DELETE ALL UNTRACKED FILES WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN COMMITTED

Branching

    MASTER 					production code (pushed live)  CI-CD continuous integration, 
    															 continuous deployment
    	DEV 				consolidated work of all approved dev commits
    						(PULL REQUEST GETS APPROVED)
    						GIT PULL FROM REST OF TEAM
    		FEATURE         NEW CODE
    		BUG-FIX         FIX ISSUES

Lab
test-repo

    MASTER (LOCK)
    
    		DEV

# Create branches

    git branch <<new-branch-name>> eg git branch dev creates branch
    git checkout <<new-branch-name>> eg git checkout dev switch from master to dev
    
    or
    
    git checkout -b <<new-branch-name>>

# Now push new branch

    git push --set-upstream origin dev
    git push -u             origin dev

# Lock master branch (cannot commit directly)

# Create a PULL REQUEST FROM DEV INTO MASTER

# Deleting a branch???

    After pull request is complete, IF ALL WORK ON THAT BRANCH IS COMPLETE THEN YES 
    YOU CAN DELETE

Lab work : 20 minutes

    Create the full lab, from scratch, with a new repo.  Put a java project in it???

Building a script from scratch

    C:\\Users\\<<username>>\\WindowsPowerShell
    
    C:\\Users\\TECH-W99a\\WindowsPowerShell
    
    
    Set EXECUTION POLICY  (admin shell)

Test Script to create / delete a folder

    echo hello
    echo world
    echo "hello world"
    rm -Recurse -Force c:\test
    md c:\test
    cd c:\test
    md childfolder
    echo "press any key to delete folder"
    pause
    cd c:\
    rm -Recurse -Force c:\test

Script To Run GitPush in One Command

    git add .
    git commit-m "<<MESSAGE>>"
    git push

Here is the script to run a FIXED GIT COMMAND

    function global:gitpush2{
    echo "about to push"
    pwd
    git pull
    git add .
    git commit -m "fixed message"
    git push
    }
    gitpush2

Lab Work

1. Split into groups of 4. Create GROUP REPO, all pull and then push in turn to simulate a real working environment (master(locked), dev, feature1/2/3/4)
2. Create two repos for your projects and push to github
