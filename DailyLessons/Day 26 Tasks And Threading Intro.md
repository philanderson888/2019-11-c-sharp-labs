Task

When we run a computer program, we run the MAIN THREAD. This is the SET OF CONTINUOUS INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE SENT TO THE CPU FOR PROCESSING. We LOCK OPEN A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL WITH THE CPU and call this a THREAD.

THREAD set of instructions SENT TO CPU FOR PROCESSING

    MAIN THREAD : APPLICATION

# Synchronous programming

... is where we wait for previous instruction to complete before moving forwards.

    Generate a POOR USER EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY OVER WEB OR DATABASE CALLS WHERE TYPICALLY IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW SECONDS TO GET THE DATA BACK

# Asychronous programming

... is where we use the power of the OPERATING SYSTEM to help us.

    We generate a
    
    	BACKGROUND TASK/THREAD 
    		AND GIVE IT RESOURCES ALLOCATED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM
    
    Main thread continues quickly
    	Background task completes and when it does the data is returned and
    	we use this data (CALLBACK METHOD)
    
    Typical example : web
    
    	HttpRequest  ==>   SENT 
    	RETURNED     <==   HttpResponse
    
    	async GetData(){
    		await GetHttpResponseDataAsync();    
    	}
    
    	We can also see this in MODERN JAVASCRIPT
    
    	OLD JAVASCRIPT : AJAX
    
    		Raw javascript : XMLHttpRequest  returns data
    
    	MODERN JAVASCRIPT : FETCH
    
    		fetch('<http://mydata.url>')             // GET DATA
    			.then(process data)                // IF SUCCESS
    			.catch(error)                      // IF FAIL
