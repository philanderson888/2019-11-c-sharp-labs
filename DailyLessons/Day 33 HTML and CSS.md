EXAMPLE

    Hello World Node Application
    
    Javascript was INVENTED as a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO RUN INSIDE NETSCAPE NAVIGAGTOR EARLY WEB BROWSER
    
    When the web took off, also Javascript was catapulted into the front line even though it was not a sophisticated language.  In fact it had some glaring bugs which exist today!
    
    Netscape => Mozilla => Firefox => Chrome dominating web
    
    	But!  Someone had the bright idea to bring Javascript out of the browser
    	and to run it as a standalone application.  Why?
    
    
    	Website
    
    	Client : Browser+Javascript               Server   PHP?
    													   ASP?
    													   Java?
    													   Python?
    
    													   Javascript!!!! Node!!!
    
    	To run NODE we just type
    	
    	>   node myFile.js

How to use libraries in a web page

    We can use external libraries (eg Bootstrap) in 2 ways
    
    1) Download the file locally.  
    	Advantage : all files under your control
    	Disadvantage : Extra pressure on your web server to deliver files
    					which it doesn't have to
    
    2) Get the files from a CDN link (CDN Content Delivery Network)
    
    	Global place for holding common files
    
    		Spaced out across world so you use the nearest server to you
    
    	Advantage : you don't host these files
    	Disadvantage : none really except careful if OFFLINE USAGE is an issue
    
    	Care !  Check that we have the right file by adding a CHECKSUM to the link  
    
    		In computing we can test the INTEGRITY or VALIDITY of a file with something we call a HASH or a CHECKSUM
    
    			sha1-online.com
    
    		Every time we run / download this file we check the file matches the HASH.

## Simple Web Tips

CSS

    .class  		Multiple occurrences   <div class="x">       .x{ ... }
    
    #id 			One occurrence         <div id="y">          #y { ... }

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    	<title>Hello World</title>
